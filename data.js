    summary: "An all-in-one insurance administration platform — from design system foundations to multi-line product launches.",
    overview: ["PolicyFly is revolutionising insurance administration for insurers who need to move fast without sacrificing compliance. As UI/UX lead, the work spans a Material Design-grounded system that ensures consistency from print collateral to complex underwriting workflows across multiple platforms.", "The design system was built to scale with a rapidly growing product suite — new lines of business, new entitlement states, new device targets. Every component decision had to serve both the designer building screens and the engineer implementing them, with no ambiguity in between.", "Over multiple years and product launches, the focus has remained the same: making sophisticated insurance workflows feel less like bureaucracy and more like a product people actually want to use."],

Extensive user, market and expert investigation mapped the hierarchy of features that would shape the ecosystem: live event widgets, social content, competitions, and a premium entitlement tier unlocking HD streaming and reduced advertising.", "Each platform app adhered to native design principles to reduce the learning curve for new users. Low content density kept each session highly discoverable, and wayfinding between events was kept deliberately intuitive — because during the Games, every second of friction is a missed moment."],

    overview: ["Following the success of Seven's PyeongChang digital campaign, the brief for Gold Coast 2018 was to go bigger — more sports, more screens, more moments. The platform needed to deliver thousands of hours of live and on-demand Commonwealth Games coverage across athletics, aquatics, cycling, wrestling and over 18 other sports.", "User research identified distinct viewing patterns — the dedicated sports follower, the casual fan tracking Australian medal stories, and families watching together across multiple devices. Each scenario demanded different navigation and content hierarchies, brought together in a single adaptive interface.", "The result scaled seamlessly from mobile first-check to living room Chromecast streaming, with personalised medal tracking, sport-by-sport scheduling, and a premium subscription tier offering HD streams and ad-free viewing for the dedicated viewer."],

An AI assistant that could capture everything was only half the solution — the real design challenge was surfacing what mattered, to the right person, at the right time.", "The meeting flow was designed around natural transitions: pre-meeting preparation, live attendance, and post-meeting review. Each phase had distinct user goals and attention states — the interface had to step back during the live session and come forward at the moments of value.", "The Hearsay workspace gives teams visibility into the conversations that shape decisions. Highlights, action items, and key moments are automatically extracted and attributed — turning what used to be a memory exercise into a shared, searchable record of how the business actually works."],
